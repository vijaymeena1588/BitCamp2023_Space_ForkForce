1. **Title:** Astronomy Application for Young Astronomers

   1. **Description:**
      - Amateur astronomers often face challenges in identifying and tagging celestial objects in the night sky. Complex features of the night sky may distract amateur astronomers from their core passion for stargazing. Amateur astronomers require a suitable platform to enhance their stargazing experiences, promote learning and community engagement, and make the hobby of amateur astronomy more accessible to a wider audience.
      - Create a user-friendly application that helps amateur astronomers in observing and identifying celestial objects with features like sky maps, object tracking, and information about constellations, planets, and stars.
      - Participants are encouraged to design an application that not only assists amateur astronomers in celestial observations but also empowers them to contribute to astronomical research, collaborate with other enthusiasts, and explore the cosmos.
