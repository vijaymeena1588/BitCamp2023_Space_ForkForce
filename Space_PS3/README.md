1. **Title:** Space Debris Tracking and Mitigation

   1. **Description:**

      - The increasing amount of space debris poses a significant threat to space exploration and satellite technology. This debris, ranging from defunct satellites to small fragments, can lead to collisions, potentially damaging operational satellites and spacecraft.
      - Develop efficient methods for tracking and mitigating space debris to ensure the safety of space missions.

   2. **Clues:**
      - You can design software that can track the trajectory of debris and warn satellites or other spacecraft to propel out of the path.
